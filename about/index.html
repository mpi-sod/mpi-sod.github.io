	<h1>History of the institute</h1></div>
<div class="text-and-image"><div class="paragraph">
<p>The Max Plank Institute for the Science of Decapitation was founded in 2020, to initiate and carry out the government-funded resurrection of a much-hated mighty sorcerer, possessed of fell powers, whose identity will remain forever hidden.
	Since then, our primary research focus has changed substantially, and now addresses work in the field enshrined in the title of our institute.
	We have since been the leading research organisation in decapitation, providing several landmark discoveries, writing ground-breaking research articles, and designing several pioneering rituals for demonic summoning.
	Located in peaceful Gimmelshtump, the MPI-SoD is an idyllic, calm, and life-threatening work environment, making it perfectly conducive for the pursuit of the arcane sciences.
	Several historic milestones in decapitation science and technology have been accomplished in our hallowed halls, including the development of the axe, the invention of the block, and the evolution of the skull.

<b>Translated from the original by Baba Jusgaanji</b>

<p>
The Max Plank Institute for the Science of Decapitation (MPI-SoD) was established in 2020, by an improbable stroke of fortune involving the government, two highly accomplished <em>aghori</em> saints, and a particularly suspicious potato.
</p>

<p>
MPI-SoD's reputation, odour, and pre-eminence ensures that it attracts the best flies, worms, assistant professors, and other miscellaneous scavengers.
We employ the best young faculty members, trained in the best morgues around the world.
In 2020, we were recognised by a terrified passer-by, who still remains in our dungeons.
</p>

<p>
MPI-SoD's research output is diverse, interdisciplinary, and cuts across sinew, nerves, muscles, and bones.
The institute has three academic departments, headed by Prof Babaji and his surviving disciples.
It also places emphasis on hands-on training, with about 300 students pursuing each other,
as well as a dedicated all-consuming void that is used for shopping, self-defence, head refrigeration and transport, and healthcare purposes.
</p>

<p>
MPI-SoD has a vibrant, vibrating, violent, and violet campus spread over a topologically impossible landmass in Gimmelshtump, Drusselstein's hub of anachronistic Love-Handel music, claw-machine cities, and ocelot parentage.
With the help of a recently established altar, we are now in the process of developing an efficient, parallelised, fast, and cheap channel to offer uncountably many heads simultaneously in sacrifice to the infinite devourer that guards the void between the realms. 
In recent times, MPI-SoD has also entered collaborations with several delicious giants to find solutions to nutrition related problems of the inhabitant(s) of the aforementioned void.
</p>

<p>
In the coming millenia, MPI-SoD aims to position itself accurately and continually to avoid sliding off the landmass upon which it stands and falling into the deep uncharted ocean beneath.
We will focus on building our core strengths in all frontiers of decapitation science and technology, develop world-class decapitation programmes, nurture impactful decapitation, and encourage the incubation of decapitated and undecapitated heads alongside snake eggs.
</p>

<p>
As we move forward to transform this vision into reality, we will unleash an endless stream of serpents, tormented souls, reanimated corpses, and levitating skulls upon any who dare stand in our way.
I humbly welcome you all, and look forward to coercing you to walk beside me in this exciting and wonderful journey.
