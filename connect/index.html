<h1>Reaching out</h1>
<p>
The institute promotes many outreach activities locally in Drusselstein (e.g. reanimation facilities at the dangerous <em>Gimmelshtump Public Wetness Maker</em>)
as well as internationally.
Many of the faculty have been involved in public engagement in India through talks organised by <a href="/research/jusgaan#jusgaanji">Baba Jusgaanji</a>.
Further, we collaborate with several third-party organisations such as the Onion Farmers' Union and the European Random Challenge.

<h2>Beyond talks and books</h2>

With the development of our <a href="/tech#arseole">ARSE-OLE</a>, we are placed in a unique position to reach out directly to trillions of people, animals, plants, and non-living objects across this world and others.
We believe strongly that this technology will allow us to eventually attain a completely <em>aghori</em> world.

	<h1>DIES: Remote instantaneous decapitation</h1>
	<p>
	Want to instantly shed 5 kg of weight?
	Persistent neck pains and headaches bothering you? 
	With our newly discovered <a href="/tech#chirays">χ-Rays™</a>, we have the solution!
	<!--Too sleepy and eyes are closing. Head spins in bewilderment.--!>
	</p>
	<p>
	
	By using this service, you can register for a near-instantaneous, probably painless decapitation delivered by our <a href="/tech#arseole">satellite ARSE-OLE technology</a>.
	Research at the institute has confirmed repeatedly that the number of problems afflicting people with heads dwarfs the number of problems that afflict those without them.
	Further, keeping heads attached to bodies quite unnecessarily takes considerable effort in an increasingly <em>aghori</em> world.
	Therefore, make the wise choice, and have your head removed today.

	We are also not responsible for the unlikely but possible event that, by clicking, you turn into a hideous orangutan.</p>
	<button onclick="return alert('Our decapitators are exhausted due to the unexpected popularity of this service. However, you are queued for decapitation. Please do not submit more requests -- unless you wish to be decapitated multiple times.')">

	<h1>DAHI: Unspeakable memory obliteration</h1>
	<p>
	Still obsessed with that person you thought you loved in high school but who showed absolutely no interest in you?
	Plagued by memories of the embarrassing sycophantic e-mail you sent your professor apologising for a delayed assignment submission?
	Guilty about the time you and your husband, the thane of Glamis and Cawdor, schemed and murdered the King of Scotland and usurped the throne, but the damned spots won't wash away now, and you never thought the old man would have so much blood in him?
	We can help you smoothen these terrible creases in your brain using our cutting-edge remote amnesia technology!
	</p>
	<p>
	The removal of memories is a core requirement for the conversion of humans to <em>aghoris</em>. 
	This technology attempts to do this on a voluntary basis.

	<p>
	Are you bored of life these days?
	Do you feel the burning unquenchable thirst for a short, pleasant, and eternal break where you can sit back and relax?
	We make you an offer you cannot refuse -- a vacation where the only goal is to escape the coils of the infinite bloodthirsty serpent pursuing you for all eternity!
	</p>

	<p>
	With the click of a button, you will be transported instantly to the void between the realms!
	Relax in the most scenic of voids, surrounded by the wailing spirits of the tormented dead!
	What's more: you will be replaced by your <em>aghori</em> twin, a copy of yourself complete with your memories, goals, deformities, and dreams.
	This unfortunate <em>aghori</em> will be damned to suffer the trials and tribulations of your life for you while you live a life worth dying for.
